# Meadow Integration

A suite of tools for managing data into a centralized non-specific schema format.

These tools are built to be usable from the command-line, as a web service, or within your own codebase.  This code repository presents these behaviors both as a suite of externally usable fable services, a command-line utility to leverage them and a set of web service behaviors.
